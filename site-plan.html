        Welcome to Dinosaur Appreciation! This site is for anyone who likes Dinosaurs 
        and wants to read about them. Be they Herbivores or Carnivores, Terrestrial or Avian, 
        from the Triassic to the Cretaceous, we love them all! Click Below to learn more!

      <h3>Herbivores</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most famous Herbivorous Dinosaur, Triceratops is easily distinguished by its 
        Three horns and head frill. Living in North America during the late Cretaceous, about 
        68 to 66 million years ago, Triceratops measured around 26 to 30 feet long and weighed up 
        to 10 tons. It lived alongside Tyrannosaurus Rex, and fossil remains suggest that battle 
        between the species wasn’t uncommon. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the earliest Dinosaur species to be discovered, Iguanodon was named in 1825 and 
        was the second species of Dinosaur to be named, following Megalosaurus the year prior. 
        Living in Europe during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, about 126 to 122 million 
        years ago, Iguanodon grew to be 30 to 36 feet long and could weigh around 5 tons. It could 
        transition between bipedal and quadrupedal motion, and its forearms featured large thumb spikes, 
        which were possibly used for defense against predators, as well as long prehensile fifth fingers 
        able to forage for food.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal favorite Dinosaur, the Ankylosaurus lived in North America during the late Cretaceous, 
        about 68 to 66 million years ago. Growing between 20 to 26 feet long, with weight estimates between 
        5 and 8 tons, Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored dinosaur. Its body was covered in hardened scales 
        called Osteoderms, and its tail ended in an Osteoderm formation resembling a club. Studies have 
        suggested that the club would have been a powerful weapon against predators like Tyrannosaurus, 
        as one good hit would likely have shattered bone.

      </ul>
      <h3>Carnivores</h3>
      <p>
        Easily the most recognizable Dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is a massive Theropod dinosaur. 
        Living in North America in the late Cretaceous, about 72 to 66 million years ago, T-Rex could 
        grow to over 40 feet in length and weigh upwards of 9 tons. It walked upright on two feet and 
        balanced a large head with a long and thick tail, while its forearms were unexpectedly small, 
        likely due to lack of use over millions of years. Tyrannosaurus is well known due to several 
        nearly complete skeletal specimens being discovered. It was an apex predator and is believed to 
        have the strongest bite force among all known terrestrial animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Named in 1824 by William Buckland, Megalosaurus was the first Dinosaur to be named by scientists, 
        its name meaning "great lizard". Its remains were first described as far back as the 17th century, 
        but were believed to be the remains of elephants or giants. Living in Southern England in the 
        Jurassic period, about 166 million years ago, Megalosaurus was a Theropod like the later T-Rex. 
        It grew about 20 feet long and weighed 1500 pounds. Megalosaurus had long, curved teeth and is 
        believed to have been a generally robust and heavily muscled animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, Carnotaurus is one of the best understood theropods 
        of the Southern Hemisphere. Living in South America in the late Cretaceous, about 72 to 69 million 
        years ago, it was a lightly built bipedal predator. It grew 24 to 26 feet long and weighed 1 to 2 tons. 
        The theropod was named for the 2 horns above its eyes, Carnotaurus meaning “meet eating bull”. 
        Studies have suggested that it was well built for running down prey, and may have been the fastest 
        large theropod.
