                <p>
                    Perhaps the most famous Herbivorous Dinosaur, Triceratops 
                    is easily distinguished by its Three horns and head frill. 
                    Living in North America during the late Cretaceous, about 68 
                    to 66 million years ago, Triceratops measured around 26 to 30 
                    feet long and weighed up to 10 tons. It lived alongside 
                    Tyrannosaurus Rex, and fossil remains suggest that battle between 
                    the species wasnâ€™t uncommon.

        <h2>Iguanodon</h2>
            <div class="iguanodon">
                <img src="images/iguanodon.jpg" alt="Iguanodon Image">
                <p>
                    One of the earliest Dinosaur species to be discovered, Iguanodon 
                    was named in 1825 and was the second species of Dinosaur to be named, 
                    following Megalosaurus the year prior. Living in Europe during the 
                    late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, about 126 to 122 million years ago, 
                    Iguanodon grew to be 30 to 36 feet long and could weigh around 5 tons. 
                    It could transition between bipedal and quadrupedal motion, and its 
                    forearms featured large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for 
                    defense against predators, as well as long prehensile fifth fingers 
                    able to forage for food.

        <h2>Ankylosaurus</h2>
            <div class="ankylosaurus">
                <p>
                    My personal favorite Dinosaur, the Ankylosaurus lived in North America 
                    during the late Cretaceous, about 68 to 66 million years ago. Growing 
                    between 20 to 26 feet long, with weight estimates between 5 and 8 tons, 
                    Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored dinosaur. Its body was covered in 
                    hardened scales called Osteoderms, and its tail ended in an Osteoderm 
                    formation resembling a club. Studies have suggested that the club would 
                    have been a powerful weapon against predators like Tyrannosaurus, 
                    as one good hit would likely have shattered bone.
