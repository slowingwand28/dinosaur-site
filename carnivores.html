                    Easily the most recognizable Dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is a 
                    massive Theropod dinosaur. Living in North America in the late 
                    Cretaceous, about 72 to 66 million years ago, T-Rex could grow to 
                    over 40 feet in length and weigh upwards of 9 tons. It walked upright 
                    on two feet and balanced a large head with a long and thick tail, 
                    while its forearms were unexpectedly small, likely due to lack of 
                    use over millions of years. Tyrannosaurus is well known due to 
                    several nearly complete skeletal specimens being discovered. It was 
                    an apex predator and is believed to have the strongest bite force 
                    among all known terrestrial animals.

        <h2>Megalosaurus</h2>
            <div class="dino">
                <p>
                    Named in 1824 by William Buckland, Megalosaurus was the first 
                    Dinosaur to be named by scientists, its name meaning "great lizard". 
                    Its remains were first described as far back as the 17th century, 
                    but were believed to be the remains of elephants or giants. Living in 
                    Southern England in the Jurassic period, about 166 million years ago, 
                    Megalosaurus was a Theropod like the later T-Rex. It grew about 20 feet 
                    long and weighed 1500 pounds. Megalosaurus had long, curved teeth and 
                    is believed to have been a generally robust and heavily muscled animal.

        <h2>Carnotaurus</h2>
            <div class="dino">

                <p>
                    Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, Carnotaurus is one of the 
                    best understood theropods of the Southern Hemisphere. Living in South 
                    America in the late Cretaceous, about 72 to 69 million years ago, it was 
                    a lightly built bipedal predator. It grew 24 to 26 feet long and weighed 
                    1 to 2 tons. The theropod was named for the 2 horns above its eyes, 
                    Carnotaurus meaning “meet eating bull”. Studies have suggested that it was 
                    well built for running down prey, and may have been the fastest large 
                    theropod.
